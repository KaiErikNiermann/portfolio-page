            "description": "I developed a Discord bot in TypeScript using the Discord.js API, which provides a simple question and answer (Q&A) system. I utilized MongoDB to store the questions and their corresponding status (e.g., solved or unsolved). The bot was hosted on AWS EC2. Additionally, I plan to use Svelte to create a dashboard page that presents an overview of the questions by accessing the database.",

            "name": "Data analysis bot",
            "description": "I developed a Discord Bot using the pycord API and implemented several features. Firstly, I created a functionality that charts chat activity over a specific time period using matplotlib. Additionally, I integrated a search feature where users can search for images using the bot, leveraging selenium for this purpose. Furthermore, I utilized the Markovify library to enable the bot to mimic the speech patterns of the server through a Markov chain. Lastly, during the development process, I gained valuable knowledge and skills in processing and visualizing large amounts of data.",

            "description": "During this project, I utilized TypeScript and Svelte to create a portfolio and notes website. The website was hosted using Vercel, ensuring its accessibility to users. As part of the website, I curated a comprehensive collection of algorithms implemented in languages such as C, Python, and TypeScript, accompanied by helpful notes. This resource aimed to assist my peers and others seeking programming guidance. Additionally, I developed another website using mdbook and hosted it via GitHub Pages. This website targeted intermediate programmers, providing them with a fast-paced introduction to the fundamentals of Scala.",
